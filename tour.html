In 1949, 50 villages were brought together to form the city of Chandigarh as the capital of Punjab in India. American planner and architect Albert Mayer was given the task of designing this city. However, after developing a mast plan, Mayerâ€™s architect-partner passed away in 1950 and the task was handed over to Le Corbusier.

    In 1966, the state of Haryana was carved out of Punjab with Chandigarh standing on the border of Punjab and Haryana. The city was then declared to be a Union Territory and the capital of both the states.</p>
